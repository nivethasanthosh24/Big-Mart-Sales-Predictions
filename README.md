# 🛒 Big Mart Sales Prediction

This project uses Machine Learning to predict product outlet sales based on the Big Mart dataset. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training using XGBoost Regressor.

## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a regression model that accurately predicts Item_Outlet_Sales using various product and outlet features.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
XGBoost

## 📊 Project Workflow

Data Collection & Loading
Handling Missing Values
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Preprocessing & Label Encoding
Train-Test Split
Model Training using XGBoost Regressor
Model Evaluation using R² Score

## 📈 Model Performance

The model performance is evaluated using the R² (R-squared) metric on both training and testing datasets.
